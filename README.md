# Hassemer's Keyfile Builder

Official release date: 15/10/2025
<br>
<br>
In order to ensure compatibility, any updates applied to this tool won't affect the resulting keyfiles in any way. This is to ensure you will be able to retrieve your keyfile, no matter when.

<br>
Dependencies:<br>
→ https://github.com/Daninet/hash-wasm<br>
→ https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes<br>
<br>
If you choose to run the JS code directly (the "script.js" file) I recommend using Node.js; the following packages are required:<br>
→ readline-sync<br>
→ @noble/hashes<br>
→ hash-wasm<br>
You can install them all with:<br>
npm install readline-sync @noble/hashes hash-wasm<br>
